This is my attempt at the euler project.

I'm giving myself an hour a day to do these. So a lot of these problems are solved with brute force instead of grace. On certain days I will refactor my code to be more graceful. I may switch languages and/or solve some problem in multiple languages.

The naming convention is "e.\.c" eg "e4.c" for euler problem 4.

e4.c:solution()         Generic Brute Ugly
e4.c:isPalindromic()    Generic Dumb Ugly
e5.c
